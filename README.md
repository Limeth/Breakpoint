# Breakpoint

This is the first ever Minecraft mini-game I (Limeth) made.
I learned to program better in Java while writing this Bukkit plugin.
Do expect bugs.

## Dependencies

- JDK 1.7
- craftbukkit-1.7.2-R0.3.jar
- NametagEdit.jar
- ProtocolLib-3.2.0.jar

## References

You may have seen this plugin at ProjectSurvive.cz and/or Craftuj.cz.
Craftuj.cz no longer runs Breakpoint.
ProjectSurvive.cz, my Minecraft gaming portal, now runs Mine-Strike instead.
